## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I'm not sure I learned much aside from how much I still have to learn. The HTML and CSS parts of this challenge were relatively easy although I didn't quite nail all the styling aspects to perfection. The javaScript part was, on the other hand, trickier than I thought. While I had a bit of experience building simple apps with JS, this is the first time that I actually tried to build something that both had behavior and was responsive and thar latter thing was the one where I found things are not as simple as I thought. In trying to incorporate responsiveness and behavioral functionality to the page, I learned how to make JS functions work on different screen sizes. I, however, don't think my overall approach to this challenge was optimal. 

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on the integration of both responsiveness and behavior. More specifically, I'd like to know what the right way to make a button work differently on differente viewpor size is, if there's any at all, or if the way to approach this is totally different from what I attempted to do this time around.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp] - This brief article by w3schools helped me make the share button toggle between showing the SNS menu and hiding it.
- [https://codepen.io/code-boxx/pen/NWwJwbN] - This resource was helpful in building a speech bubble like the one requested by the challenge. 
- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6040005/relatively-position-an-element-without-it-taking-up-space-in-document-flow] - I struggled to make some elements appear in the position I wanted them to and this stackoverflow entry helped me solve those issues, albeit in a way that feels more complicated than necessary.
